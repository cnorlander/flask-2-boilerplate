# Flask Boilerplate

This is a basic Flask web application created to be a jumping off point for future apps. Some features will include:
- Basic Auth w/ Flask Logon and Bcrypt.
- Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM.
- SQLite DB file for portability
- A Fancy logon page.
- A menu template
- Some basic page templates.
- A user managment page and simple user roles
- Docker and Docker-Compose files for easy deployment
- Gunicorn WSGI HTTP Server
- NGINX for reverse proxy and serving static files

While this project has some good bones if you decide to build your app on this you may want to do the following:
- Integrate SSO with Python-SAML or OpenID
- Swap out SQLite for a proper database such as MySQL or Postgress or go NoSQL
